**NOTE**: This library is _not_ compatible with Python versions less than Python 3.7.



## Prerequisites

*   For your convenience, you can run the following command from this directory
    to install all needed dependencies via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/):
    ```
      $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Setup Authentication and Configuration

We are assuming you've checked out the code and are reading this from a local
directory. If not, check out the code to a local directory.

1.  [Open Cloud project library](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library)

    *   Search 'Google Ads API' and Enable it.
    *   Search 'Google Drive API' and Enable it.
    *   Search 'Google Sheets API' and Enable it.
    *   Search 'YouTube Data API v3' and Enable it.

2.  Make a copy of [Template sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L-rC9kunww4Z8UVE_3pmDhbmJcuQkukFcYjQPSzByr8/copy)

3.  Set up your credentials through [step 3a. OAuth Client ID credentials (Recommended)] or [step 3b. Service Account].

    3a. Authentication using OAuth2 Client ID credentials [Installed App Flow] (Recommended for new implementation.)
    *   Open [Cloud credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
    *   Create credentials -> Create 'OAuth client ID' -> Web Application
        *   If you havenâ€™t configured consent screen, setup consent screen first.
        *   User Type: External / Publishing Status: In production
        *   If you want to run the tool in testing mode, make sure to add "test user" and add following "scopes": 
            Google Ads API, Google Drive API, Google Sheets API, YouTube Data API v3
    *   Add the follwing 'Authorized redirect URIs' : 'http://localhost:8008/' and 'http://localhost:8080/'
    *   Download the json and save the json as 'client_secret.json'
    *   Open config/setup.yaml file and update clientSecret to 'client_secret.json'
    *   Generate access token:
        *   Grant the cloud account email with 'Viewer' access to all 'Google Drives' [Cloud account email is any 'Owner' role email in]
        *   Grant the cloud account email with 'Editor' access to the 'Sheet'  you just copied in step 2.
        *   Grant cloud account email with [standard access](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6372672?hl=en) your AdWords account
            *   Cloud account email is any 'Owner' role email in [cloud project](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin)
        *   Generate the access tokens for the application with the following command:

            $ python3 auth.py

        - The app will open a browser window.
        - Login with the cloud account email and grant the app the required permissions.
        - An access/refresh token is generated for future authentication of the app and stored in the token.json file in the same folder.
        - Don't move 'token.json' as it will be used everytime the app is running.

4.  In google-ads.yaml file update following fields:

    *   [developer_token](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token)
    *   client_id
        *   Find client_id in 'client_secret' from step 3a or '_SECRETS_JSON' from step 3b.
    *   client_secret
        *   Find client_secret in 'client_secret' from step 3a or '_SECRETS_JSON' from step 3b.
    *   [refresh_token]
        *   For step 3a. OAuth2 Client ID credentials, Copy the refresh token generated in step 3a. which is stored in token.json
    *   [Optional] login_customer_id, only if you setup under [manager account](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6139186)

5.  Update configuration in the config/setup.yaml

    *   spreadsheetIds,
    *   serviceAccount,
        *   use '_SERVICE_JSON' path from step 3b. If you choose step 3a, do not change.
    *   clientSecret,
        *   use 'client_secret.json' path from step 3a. If you choose step 3b, do not change.
    *   adsAccount,
        *   use 'config/google-ads.yaml' in step 4.
    *   [Optional] to setup YouTube API to upload videos,
        *   youtubeServiceEnable = True,
        *   youtubeSecret,
            *   use 'client_secret.json' path from step 3a.
    *   [Optional] if you want the tool to automatically update mapping sheets up-to-date,
        *   refreshMappingSheetEnable = True,
    *   [Optional] if you want the specify Google Drive folder ids for uploading image/video assets,
        *   driveFolderIds = [REPLACE_DRIVE_FOLDER_IDS]
        *   Setting driveFolderIds can reduce time for searching files in the Google Drive.

6.  To run the tool in a set order at once
    (get asset file urls -> remove assets -> upload assets -> refresh mapping sheet)
    
    *   Schedule the scripts to run:
        ```
        $ python3 creative_mango_main.py
        ```
    To customize the order of each step,
    *   Schedule each script to run:
        ```
          $ python3 refresh_mapping_sheet.py
          $ python3 get_file.py
          $ python3 creative_remover.py
          $ python3 creative_uploader.py
        ```

7.  About uploading YouTube video via YouTube API

    *   Ask your Google support to help you increase the YouTube API quota.
        Default is 6 videos per day.
    *   You will need to be add as YouTube `Channel managers` to upload videos.
    *   You should see a pop window asking you to grant the access to your
        YouTube channel. You will only need to grant the access once. After you
        grant the access, you should find 'yt_token.json' generated
        in same folder. Don't move 'yt_token.json' as it will be
        used in 'youtube_api.py'. If you choose the wrong channel, you can
        delete 'yt_token.json' and rerun step 6.
